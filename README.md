🧪 First Steps with Cypress and BDD  
📌 This repository gathers my first studies in **QA Automation**, focusing on **Cypress (E2E)** and **BDD with Gherkin**.

I’ve organized the exercises into **separate projects**, each with its own README and context.

🔹 **project-e2e-realworld**  
E2E automation with **Cypress** in the **Real World App** project.

- Written in **JavaScript**  
- Executed with **Cypress**  
📝 Read the detailed README

🔹 **project-bdd-gherkin**  
Scenario modeling in **Gherkin (BDD)** for the **Login** feature.

🧠 **Goal:** Keep studies organized, showing evolution and clarity at each stage.
